# Motorverse

Motorverse is a web-based platform that allows users to buy and rent vehicles, manage their profiles, and interact with a comprehensive automotive hub. The application is built using Spring Boot for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript for the frontend. It utilizes MySQL as the database to store vehicle listings, user information, and transaction data.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven 3.6+**
- **MySQL 8.0+**
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Database Configuration
1. Create a MySQL database for the project:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE motorverse_db;
   ```
2. Update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/motorverse_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motorverse.git
cd motorverse
```

---

## Running the Application
1. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
2. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. Access the application in your web browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

---

## Usage
- **Home Page:** Navigate to the main dashboard to explore vehicle listings.
- **Login/Register:** Create an account or log in to access personalized features.
- **Buy a Car:** Browse and purchase vehicles.
- **Rent a Car:** Browse and rent vehicles for a specified duration.
- **Support:** Submit support tickets for assistance.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) (if available).

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Database Connection Issues:** Ensure MySQL is running and credentials in `application.properties` are correct.
- **Port Conflicts:** If port 8080 is in use, change the server port in `application.properties`:
  ```properties
  server.port=8081
  ```
- **Missing Dependencies:** Run `mvn clean install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **CORS Errors:** If frontend requests are blocked, ensure CORS is configured in Spring Boot.
